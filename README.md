## Explanation of Layers

### Core Layer
The **Core Layer** contains code that is shared across multiple features:
- `errors/`: Custom exception classes for error handling.
- `utils/`: Helper classes for common operations.
- `themes/`: Centralized app theme definitions.
- `constants/`: Application-wide constants like API URLs, colors, etc.
- `widgets/`: Reusable UI components not tied to a specific feature.

### Features Layer
The **Features Layer** is where each app feature/module is defined, and each feature follows the Clean Architecture layers:
1. **Data Layer**: 
   - Handles data fetching, storage, and transformation.
   - Includes models, data sources (e.g., API, database), and repositories.
2. **Domain Layer**:
   - Focused on business logic and independent of frameworks.
   - Contains use cases (business logic) and entities (core objects).
3. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Handles UI and state management.
   - Includes screens, widgets, and providers for state management.

---

## Benefits of this Structure
- **Scalability**: Adding new features without affecting existing ones is easy.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns ensures code is easier to debug and test.
- **Reusability**: Shared utilities and widgets can be reused across features.
- **Testability**: Business logic and UI are decoupled, making it easier to write unit tests.

Deployment
To deploy the application, you can use the following services:

Vercel for deploying the Next.js front-end:

Ensure environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard.
Push your changes to GitHub, and Vercel will automatically deploy the site.
Heroku for deploying the Django back-end:

Use the Heroku CLI to deploy.
Set environment variables in Heroku.
Docker for deploying the Rasa Chatbot:

Consider using Docker containers to deploy the chatbot in a cloud environment for scalability.
Communication Features
The Mind Med platform includes secure channels for communication between patients and doctors. Patients can request consultations, and doctors can provide feedback and treatment plans based on the AI analysis of the patient’s psychological state.

The chatbot serves as the initial point of contact for psychological assessments, offering users basic insights and advice before they interact with a doctor for a more detailed consultation.
